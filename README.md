# SI-221: Introduction to practical machine learning : an algorithmic approach
Repository for my work over the 2nd year course SI-221 at Télécom Paris

By following this course, students will get solid background for following tracks such as Image, Signal, Man-Machine Interaction, and Embedded systems, as well as applications related for instance to indexation or man-machine dialog. This course focuses on fundamental learning and decision approaches used in pattern recognition and data mining. These approaches will be illustrated in the fields of satellite image processing, character recognition and language recognition. The course includes a large amount of practical training courses.
